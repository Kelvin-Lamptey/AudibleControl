what i want
  listen to my voice
    use voice recognition like google's speech to text or openai's whisper
    (accurate but fast)
  intrepret my intent with the help of llms
    I will be using openrouter's api
  use the result to control items like LEDs, and and LCD display or any other device
    With serial connection to an Arduino board(UNO)

Simple interface, maybe some nice icon that bubbles or kinda reacts when things are happening
a place to show the voice recognition's output text
a place to show what the ai has decided to do
